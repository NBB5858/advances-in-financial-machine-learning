    "The sin is lookahead bias. Employment data is typically revised after its initial release, as more firms respond to the survey sent out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Also, firms that are more competent and better run will generally respond to the surveys first.  Also, only a sample of firms are ever surveyed; the total jobs estimate comes from taking employment data from the survey and scaling it up to represent the total number of firms. When then initial jobs numbers are released, the right scale factor is not known.  If the economy is contracting, it's likely that firms are going out of business and the scale factor is too high. Vice versa if the economy is growing."
